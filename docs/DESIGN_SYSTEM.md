# Design system

This is the spec for the Salapiya UI redesign (Windows and Android, one Flutter codebase). Every redesign chat follows it. When a chat needs a rule that isn't here, add it here first, then build it.

The pre-redesign design system, including its research and history, is archived at [archive/DESIGN_SYSTEM_pre-redesign.md](archive/DESIGN_SYSTEM_pre-redesign.md). It is not a rule source.

**Scope.** The redesign covers the UI layer of the real-use screens only (the `production` code paths: `lib/app`, `lib/finance`, `lib/shared`, `lib/life`, `lib/local`, `lib/connected`, `lib/design_system`). Demo and gallery screens (`lib/features/*` demo branches, `lib/gallery`, `lib/prototype`) must keep compiling and working, but they are not polished. Models, domain rules, calculations, the database, migrations, sync and auth flows do not change. A UI goal that seems to need such a change goes to the handoff under "Needs approval".

## 1. Design principles

1. **A tracker, not a bank.** Salapiya records money activity that happens elsewhere. No label, icon or flow may suggest that the app lends, borrows, pays, sends or holds money. See [§7](#7-wording-glossary).
2. **Calm canvas, purposeful surfaces.** One quiet canvas color. Cards sit on it at one surface level, and overlays (menus, dialogs, sheets) sit one level above. No card inside a card. Every card has one clear job and a title that names it.
3. **One focal value per card.** A card leads with one large value or one chart. Its label is small and muted, and its context line (period, what's included) sits below. Secondary values are smaller and grouped.
4. **Rhythm you can measure.** All spacing, radii, type sizes and colors come from tokens. Gaps between cards are equal. Edges line up across a page. Text is centered vertically in its container and never touches a border. See [§4](#4-spacing-and-alignment-rules).
5. **Color carries meaning.** Purple is the brand and primary-action accent. Status colors (success, warning, error, information) mean status only. Charts use a separate series palette. Meaning never depends on color alone: pair it with an icon, a label or a pattern.
6. **Plain words, help in place.** Say what a thing does in everyday language. When a field or option needs explaining, explain it next to that field ([§6](#6-form-help-pattern)), not in a manual or a pop-up wall of text.
7. **Exact and honest.** Money is shown exactly: full centavos, no `1.2K`-style abbreviation in balances, reviews or totals. Use tabular figures and right-align amounts in columns. Unknown is "Not available yet", never `₱0.00`. Sync state ("saved on this device", "synced") is kept separate from business state (e.g. "waiting for the recipient to confirm"). No fake success and no timer-based "Saved".
8. **Native on each platform, one system.** Windows and Android share components and tokens. Layout and input adapt to the platform ([§2](#2-platform-adaptation-android-vs-windows)).
9. **Accessible by default.** Touch targets are at least 48×48 where touch is possible. Layouts work at 200% text scale without truncating money. Everything works by keyboard with a visible focus ring. Focus is trapped in modals and returns to the trigger. Screen-reader labels are complete. Windows high contrast and reduced motion are respected. Contrast is at least 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for essential non-text indicators.
10. **Restrained motion.** Hover and press feedback take 100–120 ms. Menus and disclosures take 120–160 ms. Panels take at most 220 ms with ease-out and no bounce. No decorative or looping animation, no animated money values, no shimmer. With reduced motion on, all of these are instant.
11. **Third-party brands follow their owner's rules.** Sign-in and other provider buttons (e.g. Google) follow the provider's official branding, not the Salapiya theme.
12. **Brand stays.** The Salapiya logo and name do not change. Purple stays the accent. Use existing logo assets only; never recolor or redraw them.

### What makes the reference designs feel premium

Distilled from `apps/salapiya/assets/references/` (principles only, not copies):

- **Surface hierarchy:** a soft neutral canvas, white (or near-black) cards with a hairline border or one soft shadow, and no heavy outlines.
- **Equal geometry:** cards in a row share height, padding and radius, and the gutters between them are identical.
- **Hierarchy through size and weight, not color:** large confident numbers, small muted labels, and very few bold weights.
- **Density with breathing room:** generous outer margins and page gutters, tight and consistent grouping inside cards.
- **Data is the decoration:** small bar or line charts, progress bars and status pills instead of illustrations or banners.
- **Table-like lists:** aligned columns, right-aligned amounts, a subtle divider between rows and a quiet hover state.
- **Pill controls:** segmented period filters (Week / Month / Year) and small status pills with an icon and a label.
- **Integrated chrome:** the top bar belongs to the app (brand, navigation context, actions), not to the OS.
- **One accent moment at most per screen:** a single tinted or gradient focal card, never several.

## 2. Platform adaptation (Android vs Windows)

Layout adapts to **available width and text scale**. Platform decides **input and chrome**.

| Width class | Range (logical px) | Navigation | Content columns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact | < 600 | Android bottom dock; Windows: menu button opens the destination chooser | 1 |
| Medium | 600–999 | Collapsed sidebar rail (icons and tooltips) | 1–2 |
| Expanded | 1000–1439 | Expanded sidebar | 2–3 |
| Wide | ≥ 1440 | Expanded sidebar | Up to 4; content max width 1280 (`Space.contentMaxWidth`) |

At text scale ≥ 150%, drop one column class.

| Concern | Windows | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Window chrome | Custom integrated title bar (below). The native caption is removed. | System status bar. Top app bar with the section title, sync status and profile. |
| Primary navigation | Sidebar: logo, five destinations, profile at the bottom | Floating bottom dock with five labelled destinations; a separate + action |
| Back / forward | Title-bar buttons, Alt+← / Alt+→, mouse back/forward buttons | System back gesture or button; no forward |
| Location | Breadcrumb in the title bar (Section › Tab › Page) | Screen title in the app bar; tabs below it |
| Create actions | "New" menu button in the page header | + button above the dock opens a bottom sheet |
| Info control ([§6](#6-form-help-pattern)) | A tooltip on hover and keyboard focus; a click pins it as a popover | Tap opens a popover (a bottom sheet if the text needs more than 3 lines) |
| Dialogs | Centered, width-bounded modal | Bottom sheet for choices and short forms; full-screen page for long forms |
| Forms | Centered column, max width bounded | Full width, scrolls, keyboard insets respected |
| Row density | Single-line rows may be 40 px when pointer-only; hover state on rows | Rows at least 48 px; no hover |
| Hover | Required on every interactive element | Not used; pressed state only |
| Keyboard | Every action reachable; Esc closes the top overlay; Ctrl+N opens New | Hardware keyboard works; not required to be optimized |

### Windows title bar (Chat 5)

- **One bar across the full window width**, with app canvas or surface colors from tokens, in light and dark themes. Its height is `Space.titleBarHeight` (40).
- **Left to right:** the logo mark and "Salapiya", then back and forward buttons (disabled when there is no history), then the breadcrumb (current section › tab › page, with each earlier segment clickable), then flexible drag space, then the sync status pill, then the window controls.
- **Sync status pill:** a short label and an icon, e.g. "On this device", "Synced · 2 min ago", "Syncing…", "3 waiting", "Needs review", "Offline". Clicking it opens the sync detail. The text comes from existing runtime state only.
- **Window controls:** minimize, maximize/restore and close, using Windows 11 geometry and glyphs. Close uses the system red on hover. These are OS conventions, so they are an allowed exception to the purple accent.
- **Native behavior must keep working:** drag to move, double-click to maximize, Snap Layouts flyout on maximize hover, Aero Snap, the system menu (Alt+Space), resize borders, DPI changes, multiple monitors, and high-contrast system colors.
- **Native changes are allowed** in `apps/salapiya/windows/runner/` (currently `win32_window.cpp`, `flutter_window.cpp`, `main.cpp`). A windowing package may be added if it is maintained and works offline; state why before adding it.
- **Back/forward history is UI-layer state** over the existing navigation (destination switches and pushed pages). Routes and route names do not change.

## 3. Tokens

All tokens live in `apps/salapiya/lib/design_system/theme.dart`. Widgets read them through the theme and never write literals:

- **Color:** `CraftTheme.of(context).<role>` (a `ThemeExtension`). The Material `ColorScheme` is built from the same roles, so stock widgets match.
- **Type:** `Theme.of(context).textTheme.<role>`.
- **Spacing, radius, motion:** `Space.*`, `Radii.*`, `Motion.*`. Width-dependent spacing takes a `WidthClass` from `WidthClass.of(context)`.

Theme mode follows the existing profile setting (System, Light or Dark; System is the default). High contrast is applied automatically when the OS reports it (`MaterialApp.highContrastTheme` / `highContrastDarkTheme`).

Every text pair below is at least 4.5:1, and borders and chart series are at least 3:1 (WCAG relative luminance). `test/widget_test.dart` ("semantic foreground pairs meet normal-text contrast") checks them in all four theme variants.

### Neutrals and brand

| Role (`CraftTheme`) | Light | Dark | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `canvas` | `#F4F4F7` | `#131318` | App background and title bar |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#1C1C23` | Cards, fields, lists |
| `raised` | `#FFFFFF` | `#25242D` | Menus, dialogs, sheets, dock |
| `subtle` | `#EFEEF3` | `#2A2932` | Grouping, read-only and disabled fill |
| `text` | `#1D1B22` | `#F2F1F5` | Main text and amounts (17.0 / 15.1 on surface) |
| `secondary` | `#5E5C68` | `#B9B7C3` | Labels, captions, context lines, disabled text (6.6 / 8.6) |
| `border` | `#7A7886` | `#8D8B99` | Essential control outlines (4.3 / 5.1) |
| `divider` | `#E4E3EA` | `#35343E` | Hairlines and card edges (decorative) |
| `primary`, `focus` | `#6546A3` | `#CABDFA` | Primary action, links, focus ring, selected marker (7.1 / 9.8) |
| `onPrimary` | `#FFFFFF` | `#1E1730` | Text and icons on primary |
| `hover` / `pressed` | `#573A91` / `#4A2F7E` | `#D7CDFB` / `#BBABF3` | Primary fill states |
| `selection` / `onSelection` | `#EEE9F8` / `#4A2F7E` | `#30284A` / `#DDD3FC` | Selected row or chip; the one tinted focal card |
| `modalScrim` | black 44% | black 64% | Modal backdrop |

### Status pairs (foreground / tinted surface)

Status is always shown with an icon and a label too, never by color alone.

| Role | Light | Dark | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tone(success)` | `#146C43` / `#EDF8F1` | `#75D5A5` / `#142B22` | A completed step: synced, confirmed |
| `tone(warning)` | `#8A4B0F` / `#FFF4DF` | `#F3C16B` / `#312716` | Needs review, due soon, incomplete |
| `tone(error)` | `#B42318` / `#FFF0ED` | `#FDA29B` / `#371D22` | Validation failure, destructive action |
| `tone(information)` | `#235EA7` / `#EDF4FF` | `#9AC5FF` / `#19283B` | Explanation, planned information |
| `tone(neutral)` | `secondary` / `subtle` | same | Ordinary information |
| `overdue` | `#A1173F` / `#FDEEF2` | `#FF9DB6` / `#3A1A26` | A debt or bill past due. Rose, so it doesn't read as a form error |
| `owedToYou` | `#0E6A63` / `#E6F5F2` | `#6FD3C7` / `#102E2B` | Money others owe you. Teal, so it doesn't read as "done" |

"You owe" uses neutral `text`; Chat 10 decides whether it needs a role.

### Charts, title bar, high contrast and legacy colors

- **Chart series** (`chartSeries`, in order): violet `#6546A3` / `#CABDFA`, teal `#266C80` / `#79C4D2`, plum `#9A4C72` / `#E6BCD4`, ochre `#80631B` / `#E4C572`, blue `#395EB2` / `#A9BCFF`, neutral `#59616F` / `#B9B9C6` (light / dark).
- **Windows title bar:** `titleBar` (= `canvas`) with `text` and `secondary`. Window controls hover with `windowControlHover` (= `subtle`). Close hovers with `windowCloseHover` `#C42B1C` and a white glyph, following the OS convention.
- **High contrast** (`CraftTheme(highContrast: true)`): `secondary`, `border` and `divider` become `text`, and tinted status surfaces become `surface`. Effects are already off in high contrast.
- **Legacy:** `Palette` (`mint`, `peach`, `lilac`, `ink`, `porcelain`, `midnight`, `violet`, `lavender`) and the craft accents (`warm`, `plum`, `blue`, `focalStart`/`focalEnd`, `latticeEdge`) remain only so existing screens compile. Section chats replace their uses with the roles above; new code must not use them.

### Type scale (Geist)

Geist is the bundled variable font (`assets/fonts/geist/`, OFL 1.1 with the license shipped). It works offline, and all its weights (100–900) render from the one file. Text scales with the system setting. Sizes are the same on Windows and Android.

| Role | Size / line height | Weight | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `displayMedium` | 36 / 44 | 600, tabular | The one focal value on a screen |
| `displaySmall` | 28 / 36 | 600, tabular | Metric tile value |
| `headlineMedium` | 24 / 32 | 600 | Page title |
| `headlineSmall` | 20 / 28 | 600 | Dialog title |
| `titleLarge` | 18 / 26 | 600 | Section title |
| `titleMedium` | 16 / 24 | 600 | Card title |
| `titleSmall` | 14 / 20 | 600 | Row title, emphasis |
| `bodyLarge` | 16 / 24 | 400 | Long reading text, field input |
| `bodyMedium` | 14 / 20 | 400 | Default body |
| `bodySmall` | 12 / 16 | 400 | Captions, helper text, context lines |
| `labelLarge` | 14 / 20 | 600 | Prominent labels |
| `labelMedium` | 12 / 16 | 500 | Pills, tabs |
| `labelSmall` | 11 / 16 | 600, +0.6 tracking | Eyebrow labels, the only role that may be uppercase |

`displayLarge` (45 / 52) and `headlineLarge` (32 / 40) exist for completeness. Amounts outside the display roles add `FontFeature.tabularFigures()`. Button and chip labels stay at 13 until Chat 3 sets component metrics.

### Spacing (`Space`)

- **Scale:** `xxs` 2, `xs` 4, `sm` 8, `md` 12, `lg` 16, `xl` 24, `xxl` 32, `xxxl` 48. `target` 48 is the minimum touch target.
- **Page and card values** (from [§4](#4-spacing-and-alignment-rules), by `WidthClass`):

  | Token | Compact | Medium / Expanded | Wide |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `pageGutter(w)` | 16 | 24 | 32 |
  | `pageTop(w)`, `headerGap(w)` | 16 | 24 | 24 |
  | `sectionGap(w)` | 24 | 32 | 32 |
  | `pageBottom(w)` | 24 + dock height | 32 | 32 |
  | `cardGap(w)` | 12 | 16 | 16 |
  | `cardPadding(w)` | 16 | 20 | 20 |

- **Fixed values:** `cardHeaderGap` 12, `captionGap` 4, `fieldGap` 16, `labelGap` 8, `helperGap` 4, `groupGap` 24, `actionsGap` 24, `dialogPadding` 24, `dialogTitleGap` 12, `pillPadding` 10 × 4.
- **Widths and heights:** `formMaxWidth` 640, `reviewMaxWidth` 760, `contentMaxWidth` 1280 (the Wide content cap), `titleBarHeight` 40.
- **`WidthClass`:** compact < 600, medium 600–999, expanded 1000–1439, wide ≥ 1440. It drops one class at text scale ≥ 150%.

### Radius (`Radii`)

`control` 10 (buttons, fields, chips, tooltips), `card` 14, `overlay` 20 (dialogs, sheet top corners, menus, popovers), `pill` 999. `Space.cardRadius`, `controlRadius` and `floatingRadius` (28, the dock) are legacy aliases.

### Elevation

Two levels only:

- **Level 1 (cards):** `surface` with a 1-px `divider` border and no shadow.
- **Level 2 (overlays):** `raised` with `overlayShadow`.
  - Light: black 8% at y4, blur 16, plus black 4% at y1, blur 3.
  - Dark: black 36% at y8, blur 24. In dark, the lighter surface carries most of the separation.

Modals add `modalScrim`.

### Motion (`Motion`)

- **Durations:** `quick` 100 ms (hover, press), `short` 160 ms (menus, disclosures, tooltips), `medium` 200 ms (panels, sheets, dialogs, page transitions).
- **Curves:** `enter` is `Curves.easeOutCubic` and `exit` is `Curves.easeInCubic`. Never bounce.
- **Reduced motion:** always wrap durations in `Motion.of(context, d)`. It returns zero when reduced motion is on, from either the system setting or the profile preference.

## 4. Spacing and alignment rules

These rules are checkable. "Token" means a named value from [§3](#3-tokens). The numbers below are the values; [§3](#3-tokens) names them.

### Tokens only

- No numeric literals for spacing, size, radius, font size or color in widget code. This covers `EdgeInsets.*`, `SizedBox(height|width:)`, `BorderRadius.circular`, `fontSize:`, `Color(0x…)`, `Colors.*` and direct `Palette.*`. Use tokens and `TextTheme` roles.
- **Allowed exceptions:** `0`, a 1-px hairline, layout math derived from tokens, and OS or provider-branding values (window controls, Google button) defined in one place.
- **Check:** `grep -rEn "EdgeInsets\.[a-zA-Z]+\([^)]*[0-9]|SizedBox\((height|width): [0-9]|BorderRadius\.circular\([0-9]|fontSize: [0-9]|Color\(0x" <changed files>` returns nothing outside `design_system/theme.dart`.
- **Baseline before the redesign** (all of `lib/`, approx.): 139 `EdgeInsets` literals, 353 `SizedBox` literals, 73 `fontSize` literals, 38 radius literals, 80 hex colors (21 outside theme, gallery and p0), 133 inline `TextStyle(`. Spacing tokens are used 6 times.

### Page

| Rule | Compact | Medium / Expanded | Wide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page gutter (left and right) | 16 | 24 | 32 |
| Page top padding (below the title bar or app bar) | 16 | 24 | 24 |
| Page header (title and actions) to the first content | 16 | 24 | 24 |
| Gap between sections (groups of cards) | 24 | 32 | 32 |
| Bottom padding | dock height + 24 | 32 | 32 |

### Cards

- **Gap between cards:** one value per grid, the same horizontally and vertically: 12 compact, 16 otherwise. The grid owns the gap. Cards do not add their own outer margins, and there is no ad-hoc `SizedBox` between cards in a grid.
- **Card padding:** equal on all four sides: 16 compact, 20 otherwise.
- **Card header:** the title and the trailing action share one row and are centered on each other. Title to content: 12. A caption under the title: 4 below the title.
- **Equal heights:** cards in the same row stretch to the tallest card. No ragged bottoms and no empty gap below a shorter card.
- **No nesting:** inside a card, group with dividers or spacing, not with another bordered surface.
- **Radius:** cards use the card radius token. Controls use the control radius. Overlays use the overlay radius. No other radii.

### Rows and lists

- **Single-line row:** icon, text, amount and chevron are vertically centered. Height is at least 48 (40 is allowed on Windows when pointer-only).
- **Two-line row:** the leading icon or avatar is centered on the two-line text block. The amount is right-aligned and aligned with the first line. Height is at least 56.
- **Amounts:** tabular figures, right-aligned in their own column, with sign, currency and value kept together. An amount never floats mid-row.
- **Dividers:** dividers between rows are inset to the text start. There is no divider after the last row.
- **Text inset:** text keeps at least the card padding from any border.

### Text inside controls

- Buttons, chips, pills, tabs and fields use the theme's padding and line height. Widgets do not override vertical padding. Text and icon are optically centered: check at 100% and 200% text scale.
- **Pills and badges:** 4 vertical and 8–10 horizontal padding, from tokens.

### Forms and dialogs

- **Spacing:** fields 16 apart, label to field 8 (label above the field), helper or error 4 below the field, groups of fields 24 apart, form actions 24 below the last field.
- **Form column:** max width 640 for a single column, 760 for review layouts.
- **Dialogs:** 24 padding, 12 from title to content, 24 above the actions. Actions are right-aligned on Windows (primary rightmost). On Android they stack full width when they don't fit on one row.

### Review checklist (each section chat)

1. Spacing grep is clean on the changed files.
2. Card gaps are equal in both axes, and row heights are equal.
3. Every card has the same padding and no text touches a border.
4. Rows are vertically centered, amounts are right-aligned, and nothing is truncated at 200%.
5. Light, dark and high contrast all work.

## 5. Component rules

**Placeholder: defined in Chat 3.**

Chat 3 defines each component with its anatomy, states (rest, hover, pressed, focus, disabled with reason, busy, error), light/dark behavior and platform variants. It also builds a debug-only component gallery. These components must be covered:

- **Buttons:** primary, secondary, quiet, destructive and icon buttons.
- **Cards and metric tiles:** card, metric tile (value, label, context, trend) and section header.
- **Lists and tables:** list row (one and two lines), table and pager.
- **Fields:** text, amount, date, dropdown/select with option descriptions, segmented control, switch, checkbox and radio.
- **Info control and helper text** ([§6](#6-form-help-pattern)).
- **Dialogs:** dialog, confirmation, bottom sheet and popover. These must meet modern standards: clear title, one-sentence body, a named primary action (never just "OK"), safe Cancel, Esc/Back to close, focus trap and restore, and a scrollable body with fixed actions.
- **Feedback and states:** toast/snackbar, inline notice, empty state, loading state and status pill.
- **Navigation:** tabs and the period filter.
- **Charts:** bar, line and progress, each with an exact-value table option.
- **Google sign-in button:** follows Google Identity branding (official "G" mark bundled locally, approved light/dark/neutral styles, approved label text such as "Continue with Google"). Verify against the current Google guidelines when it is built.

## 6. Form help pattern

### When a field needs help

Add help when any of these is true:

- The label uses a domain term (e.g. "Statement", "Installment", "Split method").
- The field changes balances, schedules, sharing, or what other people see.
- The field has a format or limit (dates, intervals, counts, decimals).
- A choice can't be undone, or its effect isn't obvious from its label.
- Field options differ in consequence (e.g. split equally or by amount, payment amounts the same or different each time).

No help is needed for self-explanatory fields such as name, note, or a plain amount with a clear label. Don't add help just to fill space.

### Two layers

1. **Helper text:** always visible, under the field. One line (at most about 80 characters). It says *what to enter*, e.g. "The date on your lender's statement." When an error appears, it replaces the helper text in the same place.
2. **Info control:** an ⓘ icon button right after the label. It says *what the field or option does*, in one sentence (at most about 140 characters), e.g. "Each payment you log is matched to the earliest unpaid due date."
   - **Windows:** a tooltip on hover or keyboard focus; a click pins it as a popover until Esc or a click outside.
   - **Android:** tap opens a popover (or a bottom sheet if the text needs more than 3 lines).
   - It has a 48×48 hit area, the semantic label "About ‹field label›", and is reachable by keyboard.

### Option explanations

- In a dropdown or segmented control whose options differ in effect, each option shows a one-line description under its label in the menu (a two-line menu item).
- The selected option's description becomes the field's helper text.
- Format: the label is a short noun phrase. The description starts with a verb or with "Use when…". Example: **Same each time**: "Splits the total evenly across all payments." **Different each time**: "Use when your lender gave you a payment-by-payment schedule."

### Tone

- Plain, second person, present tense. Describe the effect on *your records*: "Counts toward this month's spending", not "Posts to the expense ledger".
- Use the "Use" column of [§7](#7-wording-glossary). Never imply that Salapiya moves money.
- No exclamation marks, "simply", "just" or blame. Overdue or error text states facts calmly.
- Errors appear inline, say what to fix, and name the field: "Enter a date on or after 2026-11-01." When there are several errors, a summary goes at the top of the form, linked to the fields. **No error pop-ups.**

## 7. Wording glossary

This glossary applies to **user-facing strings only**. Class, field, table, route and command identifiers never change. The meaning must stay exact: card credit is not cash, borrowed money is not income, and a payment between group members needs the recipient's confirmation. Section chats apply the glossary. Strings that live in domain or rule files (e.g. validation messages in `lib/finance/*_rules.dart`) need approval before they are changed.

### Verbs

- **Add** creates a thing you track: an account, a debt, a group, a task, a budget.
- **Log** records a money event that happened elsewhere: an expense, income, a payment or a transfer.
- **Edit** and **Correct** change records. Corrections keep the earlier version.
- Never use **Pay, Send, Transfer, Borrow, Lend, Settle, Request, Withdraw or Deposit** as the verb of a button, menu item or title. As nouns or past tense describing the real world, they are fine ("Paid from", "Payment", "Money you borrowed").

### Use / avoid

| Avoid (user-facing) | Use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Record borrowing | Log a new loan | "A loan you took out elsewhere" in helper text |
| Add existing debt | Add a debt | Helper text: "A debt you already have, with its current balance." |
| Record debt payment / Record payment | Log a debt payment | |
| Pay credit card | Log a card payment | |
| Pay from | Paid from | Field label |
| Transfer money | Log a transfer | "Between your own accounts" in helper text |
| Report payment / Settlement | Log a payment between members | Shared Expenses |
| Settle together / Settle up | Track who owes whom | |
| Receipt confirmation | Confirm you received it | Recipient side of a payment between members |
| Liquid money | Available money | Cash and bank; card credit excluded |
| Debt liability | What you owe | |
| Card credit / available credit | Available credit | Never shown as money you have |
| Recognized income / spending | Income / Spending | Keep "Borrowed money isn't income" where it matters |
| Accepted history / accepted | Confirmed / synced records | Depending on whether the context is sync or business |
| Net recognized, net of offsets | Net spending (refunds subtracted) | |
| Coverage | What's included | |
| Evidence | Proof, or Attachments | |
| Ledger, journal, posting, revision | *(not user-facing)* | "Edit history" for revisions |
| Pending (sync) | Waiting to sync | |
| LOCAL ONLY | On this device only | |
| Synchronization | Sync | |
| Provider (debt context) | Lender | The user's real-world lender, never Salapiya |
| Private review | Check against my records | Shared Expenses reconciliation |
| Unavailable (unknown value) | Not available yet | Never `₱0.00` for an unknown value |

### Tone rules

- **Sentence case** for every label, title and button. Uppercase is allowed only for small eyebrow labels, and only via a type token.
- **Buttons** start with a verb and name the result: "Log expense", not "Submit" or "OK".
- **Short:** one idea per sentence. Captions fit on one line at expanded width.
- **No technical or accounting jargon** in the main reading path. Exact detail goes in disclosures.
- **Friendly, not cute:** no slogans as screen titles. "Overview", not "Your day, in balance."
- **Glossary maintenance:** when a section chat finds a new term, it adds a row here before changing strings.

## 8. Dashboard data inventory

This inventory covers what the Overview can show without new domain logic. **Readable** means an existing getter or pure function returns the value as-is. **UI aggregation** means summing, grouping or filtering existing exact values inside the view; each new aggregation is listed in the handoff under "Needs approval" before it is built. **New logic** is out of scope for the UI redesign.

| Data | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Available money (confirmed); projected available money with waiting work | `LocalSession.accepted`, `.projected` (`lib/local/local_runtime.dart`) | Readable |
| This month's spending and income; spending by category | Postings in `localFinance.acceptedSnapshot` (already summed in `app/workspace_overview.dart`); `categoryName` | Readable (existing view aggregation) |
| Daily spending (sparkline) | `LocalFinancialController.spendingOn(date)` | Readable |
| Account balances | `snapshot.accounts`, `snapshot.balance(id, through:)` | Readable |
| Card debt and available credit | `LocalFinancialController.cardLiabilityAndCredit` | Readable |
| Total debt owed | `LocalFinancialController.debtTotal` | Readable |
| Per debt: next due date and amount, overdue installments and amount, status (Overdue / Due today / Due soon / Upcoming / Schedule not set), days until next, final scheduled due | `debtDueSummary`, `DebtDueSummary`, `compareDebtUrgency` (`lib/finance/debt_rules.dart`) | Readable |
| Everything due in a date range (debt installments, card statements, card installments, recurring bills) with dates and amounts | `financialReminderSources(snapshot, from, through)` (`lib/finance/planning_queries.dart`) | Readable; the weekly/monthly calendar and overdue list come from this |
| Totals due this week or this month across all debts and bills | Sum of the rows above | UI aggregation (needs approval) |
| Recurring bills and their state | `recurringOccurrences` | Readable |
| Budget progress | `budgetSpending(snapshot, budget)` with the budget record | Readable |
| Savings set aside | `savingsReserved`, `eligibleSavings` (`lib/finance/planning_rules.dart`) | Readable |
| Balance forecast | `financialForecast` (as used by Reports) | Readable |
| Shared Expenses attention counts (to confirm, waiting for others, waiting for the group, rejected, changed sources) | `runtime.connected.needMyConfirmation`, `waitingForOthers`, `sharedPendingCount`, `sharedReviewCount`, `changedPrivateSources` | Readable |
| Who owes whom per group | `SharedRepository.groups` → `SharedGroup.positions()` | Readable |
| Life agenda (tasks, events, financial reminders) | `DurableLifeController.agendaWindow` (`lib/life/life_controller.dart`) | Readable |
| Sync state: label, waiting count, needs review, download complete, connected or on this device, last synced | `LocalSession.syncLabel`, `pendingCount`, `needsReview`, `complete`, `local`; `lastSyncedAt` (`lib/connected/connected_runtime.dart`) | Readable (check that `lastSyncedAt` is exposed to the UI in Chat 5 or 6) |
| Amount privacy | `session.hideAmounts` | Readable; every dashboard value must respect it |
| Month-over-month or longer trends outside Reports | Not available as a query | New logic, or UI aggregation over postings (needs approval) |

## 10. Decision log

| Date | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-29 | The redesign covers real-use (production) screens only. Demo and gallery screens keep working but are not polished. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Windows gets a custom integrated title bar. Native runner code may change, and a windowing package may be added. This supersedes the pre-redesign rule "native caption only, no window-management dependency". | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Section chat order in §9 (Debts first, Onboarding last; Money, Shared Expenses and Life each split in two). | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | The pre-redesign design system moves to `docs/archive/DESIGN_SYSTEM_pre-redesign.md`. This document replaces it. | Done |
| 2026-10-29 | Carried over from the archive: the exact-money rules, the accessibility rules, the motion limits, Geist as the typeface, separate sync and business states, and the status color pairs as the starting palette. | Approved (with this spec) |
| 2026-10-29 | The spacing values in §4, and the Add/Log verb split and glossary in §7. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Redesign work moves to its own branch, `redesign/ui`, created from `docs/normalize`. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Tokens (Chat 2): purple-tinted neutrals, primary `#6546A3` / `#CABDFA` kept, archived status pairs kept, new `overdue` (rose) and `owedToYou` (teal) roles, chart series from the archive, and a high-contrast variant. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Geist stays the only UI font (already bundled, OFL 1.1). The type scale is in §3. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Radii are control 10, card 14, overlay 20 and pill. Elevation has two levels (hairline cards, shadowed overlays). Motion is 100 / 160 / 200 ms with ease-out. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Wide content max width is 1280, and the Windows title bar height is 40. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | The existing System/Light/Dark profile setting stays the theme-mode control. | Approved |
| 2026-10-29 | Totals added up across debts and bills per week or month for the dashboard. | Needs approval (Chat 6) |
| 2026-10-29 | Rewording user-facing messages that live in domain or rule files. | Needs approval (per section chat) |
